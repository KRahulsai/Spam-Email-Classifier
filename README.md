# Spam-Email-Classifier
Built a simple AI Spam Email Classifier using Python and Machine Learning. The model is trained with labeled messages and uses CountVectorizer to convert text into numbers. A Naive Bayes algorithm predicts whether new messages are spam or not spam. The system provides quick real-time classification through user input.
